%Dear students, \\
%here you can find a complete description of the sections that you need to write for the mini-report. You have to write a mini-report of \textbf{max 1 page (references, tables and images are excluded from the count)} for each last exercise of labs 4 (LM) and 5 (NLU). \textbf{Reports longer than 1 page will not be checked.} The purpose of this is to give you a way to report cleanly the results and give you space to describe what you have done and/or the originality that you have added to the exercise.
%\\
%\textbf{If you did part A only, you have to just report the results in a table with a small description.}

\section{Introduction (approx. 100 words)}
The project aimed to improve the baseline RNN performance by incrementally adding 
features and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden units,
embedding size). The model was trained on the Penn Treebank dataset, using perplexity
as the main evaluation metric. In the second part, advanced techniques were 
incorporated to further enhance the language model, including Weight Tying 
to reduce parameters, Variational Dropout (excluding DropConnect) for 
regularization, and Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent (AvSGD) for better
optimization. These improvements aimed to enhance generalization and 
convergence while maintaining low perplexity (less than 250). 
\section{Implementation details (max approx. 200-300 words)}
Do not explain the backbone deep neural network (e.g. RNN or BERT). Instead, focus on what you did on top of it. \textbf{Add references if you take inspiration from the code of others}

\section{Results}
Add tables and explain how you evaluated your model. Tables and images of plots or confusion matrices do not count in the page limit.
